## Key Improvements

### 1. Complete Database Representation

- All database tables now have corresponding SQLAlchemy models
- All database fields are properly represented in the models
- Proper relationships and foreign keys are defined

### 2. Enhanced API Models

- Comprehensive Pydantic models for all database entities
- Proper request/response models for CRUD operations
- Search and filtering capabilities for all major entities
- Validation rules and constraints properly defined

### 3. Better Organization

- Models are organized by functionality (users, LTM, conversation, RBAC, MFA)
- Clear separation between SQLAlchemy and Pydantic models
- Consistent naming conventions across all models

### 4. Modern Pydantic v2 Support

- Updated to use `model_config` instead of deprecated `Config` class
- Proper use of `ConfigDict` for configuration
- Maintained backward compatibility where possible

## Validation and Testing

### Linting

- All new and updated files pass linting checks
- No syntax errors or import issues
- Proper type hints and documentation

### Model Consistency

- SQLAlchemy models match database schema exactly
- Pydantic models properly represent database fields
- Relationships are properly defined and consistent

## Next Steps

1. **Testing** - Create unit tests for all new models
2. **API Endpoints** - Implement API endpoints using the new models
3. **Migration** - Ensure database migrations are up to date
4. **Documentation** - Update API documentation with new models
5. **Integration** - Test integration with existing services
