## ü§ñ **AI Questions for Clarification**

### **1. Context Quality Thresholds**

**Question**: What specific metrics should we use to measure context quality and relevance? Should we implement:

- Semantic similarity scoring (e.g., cosine similarity, BERT embeddings)?
- User input matching algorithms (keyword matching, intent recognition)?
- Focus area integration scoring?
- Recency weighting factors?

**Why this matters**: This will determine how we implement the relevance scoring algorithm and what constitutes "90%+ relevant context."

---

### **2. Performance Targets**

**Question**: Are the current performance targets realistic and achievable?

- **Context Processing Time**: <100ms for context selection and formatting
- **Memory Usage**: 20% reduction in memory footprint
- **Response Time**: Maintain or improve current response times

**Why this matters**: We need to ensure these targets are achievable given the current system constraints and don't create unrealistic expectations.

---

### **3. Backward Compatibility**

**Question**: How critical is it to maintain 100% backward compatibility vs. allowing breaking changes for significant improvements?

**Options**:

- **Option A**: Maintain full backward compatibility (slower progress, more complex code)
- **Option B**: Allow breaking changes for major improvements (faster progress, cleaner code)
- **Option C**: Gradual migration with deprecation warnings

**Why this matters**: This affects our implementation strategy and how we can refactor the existing state management system.

---

### **4. Testing Strategy**

**Question**: Should we implement A/B testing to measure the impact of context optimization on user experience?

**Considerations**:

- **Pros**: Quantitative measurement of improvements, user experience validation
- **Cons**: Increased complexity, need for user segmentation, longer validation time

**Why this matters**: This will help us validate that our optimizations actually improve user experience, not just technical metrics.

---

### **5. Integration Priority**

**Question**: Which components should we prioritize first?

- **Context optimization** (smart selection, relevance scoring)
- **State management** (segmentation, metadata)
- **LLM information flow** (formatting, summarization)

**Why this matters**: This affects our implementation order and risk management strategy.

---

### **6. Context Summarization Strategy**

**Question**: How aggressive should we be with context summarization?

- **Conservative**: Only summarize when absolutely necessary (>1000 chars)
- **Moderate**: Summarize when context exceeds 500 chars
- **Aggressive**: Always summarize to maintain optimal context size

**Why this matters**: This affects the balance between context completeness and LLM processing efficiency.

---

### **7. Memory Constraints**

**Question**: What are the current memory usage patterns and constraints?

- **Current memory usage**: How much memory does the current system typically use?
- **Memory limits**: Are there hard limits we need to respect?
- **Scaling**: How does memory usage scale with conversation length and context size?

**Why this matters**: This will help us set realistic memory reduction targets and understand the impact of our optimizations.

---

### **8. Error Handling Strategy**

**Question**: How should we handle context optimization failures?

- **Fallback**: Continue with unoptimized context if optimization fails?
- **Fail-fast**: Stop execution if context optimization fails?
- **Degraded mode**: Use simplified optimization if advanced features fail?

**Why this matters**: This affects system reliability and user experience when things go wrong.

---

### **9. Monitoring and Alerting**

**Question**: What level of monitoring and alerting do we need for context optimization?

- **Basic**: Log errors and performance metrics
- **Moderate**: Alert on performance degradation and quality issues
- **Advanced**: Real-time monitoring with predictive alerts

**Why this matters**: This affects our operational overhead and ability to catch issues early.

---

### **10. User Experience Impact**

**Question**: How should we measure and validate user experience improvements?

- **Quantitative**: Response quality scores, user satisfaction metrics
- **Qualitative**: User feedback, conversation flow analysis
- **Hybrid**: Combination of both approaches

**Why this matters**: This will help us validate that our technical improvements actually benefit users.
