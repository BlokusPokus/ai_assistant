# AI Task Tracker Implementation

## Task Overview

Implement a comprehensive AI task management system that mirrors the sophisticated task tracking capabilities used in AI coding assistants, specifically designed to differentiate from user todos and provide intelligent workflow management for the personal assistant.

## Context

Based on analysis of the AI coding assistant's todo management system, we need to implement a similar structured approach for managing AI-generated tasks within the personal assistant application. This system should provide:

1. **Intelligent Task Breakdown**: Automatically decompose complex requests into manageable subtasks
2. **Status Tracking**: Real-time status updates with four states (pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
3. **Dependency Management**: Handle task prerequisites and parallel execution
4. **Proactive Management**: Automatically create tasks for complex multi-step operations
5. **Separation from User Todos**: Clear distinction between AI-managed and user-managed tasks

## Key Differences from User Todos

### AI Task Tracker Characteristics:

- **Automatically Generated**: Created by AI when processing complex requests
- **Structured Dependencies**: Tasks have prerequisite relationships
- **Proactive Creation**: Generated based on complexity analysis (3+ steps)
- **Real-time Updates**: Status changes immediately upon completion
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent tasks can run simultaneously
- **Minimum Requirements**: Always has at least 2 tasks per list
- **Testing Integration**: Can include testing tasks when requested

### User Todo Characteristics:

- **Manually Created**: User-initiated task creation
- **Simple Structure**: Basic task management without complex dependencies
- **User Control**: Full user control over creation, modification, and deletion
- **Personal Organization**: Individual task management

## Technical Requirements

### In-Memory Task Management

- Session-based task storage (no database persistence)
- Real-time task creation and management
- Dependency resolution logic
- Parallel execution support
- Status tracking and updates
- Integration with existing personal assistant workflow

### Backend Implementation

- In-memory task management service
- Dependency resolution algorithms
- Parallel execution coordination
- Real-time status updates
- Session-based task storage

### Frontend Components

- AI Task Dashboard with dependency visualization
- Real-time status updates
- Parallel task execution indicators
- Session-based task display
- Visual distinction from user todos

## Implementation Phases

1. **Analysis & Design** (Current)
2. **In-Memory Service Design**
3. **Backend Service Development**
4. **Frontend Component Creation**
5. **System Integration**
6. **Documentation & Testing**

## Success Criteria

- AI can automatically create structured task lists for complex requests
- Clear visual and functional separation from user todos
- Real-time status tracking and updates
- Dependency management and parallel execution
- Comprehensive documentation and onboarding materials
