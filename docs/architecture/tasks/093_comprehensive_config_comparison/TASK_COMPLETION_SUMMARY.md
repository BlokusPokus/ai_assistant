### ðŸ”’ Security Improvements (2 weeks)

1. **Implement Environment Variable Encryption** - Secure sensitive data
2. **Move to Secure Credential Management** - Remove hardcoded credentials
3. **Add Configuration Monitoring** - Monitor configuration changes
4. **Implement Automated Validation** - Prevent configuration drift

## Validation Procedures

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] OAuth authentication flows (Google, Microsoft, Notion)
- [ ] SMS functionality with Twilio
- [ ] Application startup and logging
- [ ] Database connectivity
- [ ] API endpoint functionality
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Security configurations

### Success Criteria Met

- [x] All configuration files compared and documented
- [x] All discrepancies identified and categorized
- [x] Security review completed with recommendations
- [x] Implementation plan created with priorities
- [x] Comprehensive documentation provided
- [x] Validation procedures defined

## Risk Assessment

### Risks Identified

- **Authentication Failures**: OAuth configuration mismatches could break auth
