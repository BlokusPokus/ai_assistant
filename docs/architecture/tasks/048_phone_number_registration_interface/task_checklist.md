## üéØ **Task Objectives**

Transform the existing phone management functionality from a profile-only feature into a prominent dashboard component, providing users with easy access to phone number management, verification, and testing capabilities.

**IMPORTANT DISCOVERY**: The existing implementation is already **95% complete** and enterprise-grade. This task is primarily about **dashboard integration** and **SMS testing functionality**, not building phone management from scratch.
