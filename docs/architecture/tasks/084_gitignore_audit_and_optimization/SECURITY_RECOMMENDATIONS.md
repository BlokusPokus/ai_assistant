# Task 084: Security Recommendations

## Critical Security Issues Resolved

### 1. JWT Token Exposure (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: Active JWT tokens stored in `cookies.txt`

- Refresh token: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
- Access token: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`

**Risk**: These tokens could be used to impersonate users
**Resolution**: âœ… Added `cookies.txt`, `*.cookies`, `session_*.txt` to .gitignore

### 2. Production Database Schema Exposure (HIGH)

**Issue**: Complete production database structure in `prod_schema.txt`

- Contains all table definitions, relationships, and constraints
- 376 lines of sensitive production data

**Risk**: Exposes production database architecture
**Resolution**: âœ… Added `*schema*.txt`, `*schema*.sql` to .gitignore

### 3. Production Reset Script Exposure (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: `reset_production_schema.sql` contains DROP TABLE commands

- 869 lines of destructive SQL commands
- Could be used to destroy production database

**Risk**: Potential for production database destruction
**Resolution**: âœ… Added `reset_*_schema.sql` to .gitignore

## Immediate Security Actions Required

### 1. Token Rotation (URGENT)

**Action**: Rotate all JWT tokens that were exposed
**Reason**: Tokens in `cookies.txt` may have been compromised
**Steps**:

1. Invalidate current tokens
2. Generate new tokens
3. Update authentication system
4. Notify users of re-authentication requirement

### 2. Database Security Review

**Action**: Review production database security
**Reason**: Schema exposure may indicate other security gaps
**Steps**:

1. Audit database access controls
2. Review connection strings and credentials
3. Check for other schema files
4. Implement additional monitoring

### 3. Repository History Cleanup

**Action**: Check if sensitive files were ever committed
**Reason**: Even if now ignored, files may exist in git history
**Steps**:

1. Search git history for sensitive files
2. Use `git filter-branch` or BFG to remove if found
3. Force push cleaned history
4. Notify team of repository changes

## Ongoing Security Best Practices

### 1. Pre-commit Security Hooks

**Recommendation**: Implement pre-commit hooks to detect sensitive data
**Implementation**:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Create .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets
    rev: v1.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: detect-secrets
        args: ['--baseline', '.secrets.baseline']
```

### 2. Regular Security Scans

**Recommendation**: Monthly automated security scans
**Tools**:

- `git-secrets` - AWS secrets detection
- `truffleHog` - High entropy string detection
- `detect-secrets` - Comprehensive secret detection

### 3. Environment Variable Management

**Recommendation**: Use proper environment variable management
**Best Practices**:

- Never commit `.env` files
- Use `.env.example` for templates
- Use secure secret management systems
- Rotate secrets regularly

### 4. Database Schema Management

**Recommendation**: Proper database schema versioning
**Best Practices**:

- Use migration systems (Alembic, Flyway)
- Store schemas in version control (without sensitive data)
- Use separate environments for dev/staging/prod
- Never commit production schemas

## Team Training Requirements

### 1. File Management Guidelines

**Training**: Educate team on proper file management
**Key Points**:

- Never commit sensitive files
- Use .gitignore effectively
- Understand file classification system
- Report security concerns immediately

### 2. Security Awareness

**Training**: Regular security awareness sessions
**Topics**:

- Recognizing sensitive data
- Proper secret management
- Incident response procedures
- Security best practices

### 3. Development Workflow

**Training**: Secure development practices
**Guidelines**:

- Use development databases only
- Never use production data in development
- Implement proper testing practices
- Follow security-first development

## Monitoring and Alerting

### 1. Repository Monitoring

**Implementation**: Monitor repository for security issues
**Metrics**:

- Repository size growth
- New file types added
- Sensitive pattern detection
- Unusual commit patterns

### 2. Access Monitoring

**Implementation**: Monitor access to sensitive resources
**Alerts**:

- Unusual database access patterns
- Failed authentication attempts
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Unauthorized file access

### 3. Automated Security Checks

**Implementation**: CI/CD security integration
**Checks**:

- Secret detection in commits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security analysis
- Infrastructure security scanning

## Incident Response Plan

### 1. Immediate Response

**Steps**:

1. Assess scope of exposure
2. Rotate compromised credentials
3. Notify security team
4. Document incident

### 2. Investigation

**Steps**:

1. Determine how files were exposed
2. Check git history for other exposures
3. Review access logs
4. Identify root cause

### 3. Recovery

**Steps**:

1. Implement additional security measures
2. Update procedures and training
3. Monitor for ongoing issues
4. Conduct post-incident review

## Compliance and Documentation

### 1. Security Documentation

**Requirements**:

- Document all security measures
- Maintain incident response procedures
- Keep security training materials updated
- Regular security policy reviews

### 2. Audit Trail

**Requirements**:

- Log all security-related changes
- Maintain access logs
- Document security decisions
- Regular security assessments

### 3. Compliance Monitoring

**Requirements**:

- Regular compliance checks
- Security policy adherence
- Training completion tracking
- Incident response testing

## Conclusion

The security issues identified in Task 084 represent significant risks that have now been resolved. However, ongoing vigilance and proper security practices are essential to prevent future exposures. The recommendations above provide a comprehensive framework for maintaining repository security and protecting sensitive data.
