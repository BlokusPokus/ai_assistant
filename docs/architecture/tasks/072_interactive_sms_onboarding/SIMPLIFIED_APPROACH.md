# Simplified Approach: Website Link Onboarding

## 🎯 **Simplified Flow Overview**

Instead of email collection, we'll provide direct website links with the phone number pre-filled. This eliminates the complexity of email validation, sending, and confirmation while still providing a smooth onboarding experience.

## 🏗 **Simplified Technical Architecture**

### **Core Components**

1. **OnboardingConversationManager**

   - Manages conversation state and flow progression
   - Handles user input parsing (A, B, C, YES)
   - Coordinates with response formatter

2. **OnboardingResponseFormatter**

   - Generates contextual messages for each step
   - Creates personalized signup links with phone numbers
   - Handles message formatting and length optimization

3. **OnboardingSessionStorage**
   - Stores temporary conversation state
   - Handles session cleanup and expiration
   - Provides quick lookups by phone number

### **Simplified Database Schema**

```sql
CREATE TABLE sms_onboarding_sessions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    phone_number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    current_step VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    collected_data JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT (NOW() + INTERVAL '1 hour')
);
```

### **Onboarding Steps**

```python
class OnboardingStep(Enum):
    WELCOME = "welcome"
    FEATURE_OVERVIEW = "feature_overview"
    QUICK_START = "quick_start"
    LEARN_MORE = "learn_more"
    SIGNUP_LINK = "signup_link"
    CONFIRMATION = "confirmation"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
```
