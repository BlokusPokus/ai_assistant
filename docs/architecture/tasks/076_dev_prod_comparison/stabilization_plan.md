- **Log Levels**: Dev uses `DEBUG` level, Prod uses `INFO/WARNING`
- **Database URLs**: Different connection strings and credentials
- **OAuth Redirect URIs**: Dev uses `localhost:8000`, Prod uses `ianleblanc.ca`

#### 2. Docker Configuration

- **Ports**: Dev uses `8080:80`, Prod uses `80:80`
- **SSL**: Different SSL certificate paths
- **Resource Limits**: Prod has memory/CPU limits, Dev doesn't
- **Health Checks**: Different configurations

#### 3. Database Configuration

- **Users**: Dev uses `ianleblanc`, Prod uses `prod_user`

3. **SSL Certificates**: Risk of service interruption
4. **API Keys**: Risk of service failures

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Backup Before Changes**: Always backup production
2. **Staged Rollouts**: Test in staging first
3. **Rollback Plans**: Prepare rollback procedures
4. **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring during changes

## 📞 Emergency Procedures

   - Check service status
   - Review recent changes
   - Activate rollback if needed

2. **Communication**:

   - Notify stakeholders
   - Update status page
   - Document incident

3. **Recovery**:
   - Execute rollback procedure
   - Validate service recovery
   - Post-incident review

### If Configuration Drift Detected

1. **Assessment**:

   - Identify drift source
   - Assess impact
   - Plan remediation

2. **Remediation**:

   - Apply fixes
   - Validate changes
