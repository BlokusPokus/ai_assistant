# Task 096: Grocery Deals Tool Implementation

## Summary

Implement a comprehensive grocery deals tool that allows users to search, analyze, and manage IGA grocery deals from the automated scraping system. This tool will provide intelligent shopping assistance, budget planning, and deal analysis capabilities.

## Problem Statement

Users need an intelligent way to interact with the grocery deals data that's being automatically scraped and stored in the database. Currently, the deals data exists but there's no user-facing tool to:

- Search and filter deals
- Plan meals within budgets
- Analyze deal value and savings
- Manage shopping preferences and alerts

## Solution Design

Create a comprehensive `grocery_deals_tool` with four core methods:

### Core Methods:

1. **`search_deals()`** - Search and filter grocery deals
2. **`plan_budget_meals()`** - Budget-based meal planning
3. **`analyze_deals()`** - Deal analysis and comparisons
4. **`manage_deals()`** - User preferences and deal management

### Key Features:

- **Intelligent Search**: Fuzzy search, category filtering, price ranges
- **Budget Optimization**: Find best deals within specified budgets
- **Value Analysis**: Compare deals, calculate savings, find best value
- **User Management**: Alerts, preferences, shopping history
- **Meal Planning**: Recipe-based shopping with deal optimization

## Technical Architecture

### Tool Metadata System:

The grocery deals tool must include comprehensive metadata to help the AI understand and use the tool effectively:

```python
# src/personal_assistant/tools/metadata/grocery_deals_metadata.py
def create_grocery_deals_tool_metadata() -> ToolMetadata:
    """Create comprehensive metadata for the grocery deals tool."""

    use_cases = [
        ToolUseCase(
            name="Search for Produce Deals",
            description="Find fresh produce deals within a price range",
            example_request="Find all fruit deals under $3",
            example_parameters={
                "query": "fruit",
                "category": "Produce",
                "max_price": 3.00
            },
            expected_outcome="List of fruit deals under $3",
            success_indicators=["deals_found", "price_filtered", "category_matched"],
            failure_modes=["no_deals_found", "invalid_price", "category_mismatch"]
        ),
        # ... more use cases
    ]

    return ToolMetadata(
        tool_name="grocery_deals_tool",
        description="Search, analyze, and manage IGA grocery deals",
        complexity=ToolComplexity.MODERATE,
        category=ToolCategory.INFORMATION,
        use_cases=use_cases,
        # ... additional metadata
    )
```

### Database Integration:

```sql
-- Optimized queries for deal search
SELECT * FROM grocery_deals
WHERE name ILIKE '%query%'
AND price_text::numeric BETWEEN min_price AND max_price
AND valid_to > NOW()
ORDER BY price_text::numeric ASC;

-- Budget optimization query
SELECT * FROM grocery_deals
WHERE price_text::numeric <= budget
AND categories @> '["category"]'
ORDER BY price_text::numeric ASC;
```

### Tool Structure:

```python
class GroceryDealsTool:
    def search_deals(self, query: str, category: str = None,
                    max_price: float = None, min_price: float = None) -> str:
        """Search grocery deals with filters."""

    def plan_budget_meals(self, budget: float, meal_type: str = "weekly") -> str:
        """Plan meals within budget using current deals."""

    def analyze_deals(self, deal_ids: List[int], analysis_type: str = "compare") -> str:
        """Analyze deals for best value and comparisons."""

    def manage_deals(self, action: str, user_id: int, **kwargs) -> str:
        """Manage user preferences, alerts, and deal tracking."""
```

## Success Metrics
