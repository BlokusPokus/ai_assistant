- **Maintainability**: Clean, documented, and testable code

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Microservices Architecture

The system is decomposed into loosely coupled, independently deployable services:

- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for all client requests
- **Authentication Service**: User authentication and authorization
- **User Management Service**: User profiles and preferences
- **Chat Service**: AI-powered conversation management
- **OAuth Service**: External service integration
- **SMS Router Service**: Multi-user SMS management
- **Analytics Service**: Usage tracking and reporting
- **Session Service**: User session management

### 2. Domain-Driven Design

Each service is organized around business domains:

- **User Domain**: Authentication, profiles, preferences
- **Communication Domain**: Chat, SMS, notifications
- **Integration Domain**: OAuth, external APIs
- **Analytics Domain**: Metrics, reporting, insights
- **Security Domain**: RBAC, audit, compliance

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture

Services communicate through events for loose coupling:

- **User Events**: Registration, login, profile updates
- **Communication Events**: Messages, notifications, status changes
- **Integration Events**: OAuth flows, data synchronization
- **Analytics Events**: Usage tracking, performance metrics

### 4. API-First Design

All services expose well-defined REST APIs:

- **OpenAPI Specification**: Complete API documentation
- **Versioning**: Backward-compatible API evolution
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **Authentication**: JWT-based security
