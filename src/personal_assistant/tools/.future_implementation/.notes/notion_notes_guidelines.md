### üéØ Layout Best Practices:

#### 1. **Consistent Structure**

- Use the same header hierarchy across similar note types
- Maintain consistent spacing between sections
- Apply uniform formatting for similar elements

#### 2. **Scannable Content**

- Use bullet points and numbered lists for easy reading
- Break long paragraphs into shorter sections
- Use bold text to highlight key information
- Include visual separators between major sections

#### 3. **Logical Flow**

- Start with overview information
- Progress from general to specific details
- Group related information together
- End with actionable next steps

#### 4. **Visual Balance**

- Don't overcrowd sections with too much information
- Use white space effectively
- Balance text-heavy sections with lists and tables
- Keep individual sections focused on one main topic

#### 5. **Accessibility**

- Use descriptive headers for screen readers
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background
- Keep line lengths reasonable (60-80 characters)
- Use consistent formatting patterns

### üö® Common Layout Mistakes:

#### ‚ùå **Avoid These:**

- **Wall of text**: Long paragraphs without breaks
- **Inconsistent formatting**: Mixing different styles randomly
- **Poor hierarchy**: Using wrong header levels
- **Over-nesting**: Too many nested list levels
- **Missing whitespace**: Cramped, hard-to-read content

#### ‚úÖ **Do This Instead:**

- **Break up content**: Use headers, lists, and spacing
- **Maintain consistency**: Apply uniform formatting rules
- **Follow hierarchy**: Use headers in logical order (H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3)
- **Limit nesting**: Keep lists to 2-3 levels maximum
- **Add breathing room**: Use proper spacing between sections

### üîß Layout Customization Tips:

#### For Different Note Types:

- **Meeting notes**: Focus on action items and decisions
- **Project notes**: Emphasize progress and milestones
- **Research notes**: Highlight findings and conclusions
- **Personal notes**: Use more flexible, journal-style formatting

#### For Different Audiences:

- **Personal use**: More casual, flexible formatting
- **Team sharing**: Structured, professional layout
- **Client presentation**: Clean, minimal design
- **Academic work**: Formal, citation-heavy format
