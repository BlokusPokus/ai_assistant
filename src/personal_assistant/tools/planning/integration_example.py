ðŸŽ¯ TASK PLANNING RECOMMENDATION:

For complex tasks, consider using the `create_intelligent_plan` tool to:
â€¢ Break down requests into clear, manageable steps
â€¢ Identify the most appropriate tools for each step
â€¢ Get context-specific guidance for tool usage
â€¢ Create a structured approach to completion
â€¢ Receive ADHD-friendly execution guidance

This will help ensure efficient and effective task completion.

"""
# In your main.py or wherever you initialize tools:

from .tools.planning import LLMPlannerTool

# Initialize the planner
